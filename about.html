      <section class="content">
        <p>I am Leo Maia, a Brazilian designer with 16+ years of experience living in Amsterdam and working at Booking.com since 2014. I have a bachelor degree in Industrial Design / Visual Communication (2005) and a post-grad in Ergonomics & Human-computer Interaction (2006).</p>

        <p>I am really driven towards understanding and solving complex problems using an iterative process comprised of user research, leveraging data insights, diverse forms of exploration, interaction and visual design. **Learn more about my process**.</p>

        <p>The creative process is my biggest passion and it's a double win for me whenever I am able to apply any form of creative thinking into my work otherwise I seek to build and create whenever time allows me. That usually means drawing, working on a illustration, a person's portrait or playing the bass and making music.</p>

        <p>Make sure to check **my portfolio** where you can find some of the **UX cases** I worked on and a bunch of the **illustrations** I've done. If you're curious about the music bit, you can check **my Soundcloud profile** or **this other project** I can't promise it is good, but it's something I have fun doing and tells a bit more about me.</p>

          <p>
            As a people manager (Team Lead), I managed multiple cross-functional product teams holding weekly 1-1s with every team member, supporting them pursuing their career goals and managing their performance by giving timely and actionable feedback. I worked closely with Product Managers to monitor teams health and refine processes organising and facilitating retros, resolving conflicts within my team and across my track and removing blockers whilst delivering on my UX Designer role duties.
