        <h3 class="heading-1">My process</h3>

        <p>My process tends to be very informal but comprises of an iterative approach using varied methods as needed. It may start out as simple as writing a doc with basic requirements up until implementing designs for production and validating them. In between I make use of different techniques to map out the user flows, explore and refine solutions using low to high fidelity mock-ups, plan and participate on user research, implement, run AB tests and analyse their results.</p>

            <li>As we moved on I started refining those mock-ups using more high-fidelity language to get closer to what would be the real thing and gather further feedback from our potential users.</li>
